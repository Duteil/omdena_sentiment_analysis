# Omdena_sentiment_analysis

This is the capstone project for a course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) by Omdena. The goal was to develop and deploy a web application for sentiment analysis using Python, Streamlit, and various NLP techniques. 

This project is an academic demonstration of skills in NLP and deployment of a machine learning model as a web app. The app uses several machine learning models to analyze the sentiment of a given text, offering insights into the feelings or attitudes expressed within it. It is not intended for commercial use or contribution.
